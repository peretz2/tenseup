        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 5, 2026</p>

        <p>TenseUp ("we", "our", or "the App") is an AI-powered English grammar practice application. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Voice & Text Data:</strong> When you use the speech-to-text feature, your spoken words are transcribed on your device using Apple's Speech framework. The transcribed text is sent to OpenAI's API for grammar analysis. We do not store your voice recordings or transcriptions on our servers.</p>
        <p><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to TenseUp Pro, payment is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment details. We receive only a confirmation of your subscription status through RevenueCat, our subscription management service.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We track basic usage counts (e.g., daily practice sessions) locally on your device using UserDefaults. This data is not transmitted to any server.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <p><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> Your transcribed text is sent to OpenAI for grammar analysis. Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for information on how they handle data.</p>
        <p><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage subscriptions. RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID to verify subscription status. See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Apple Speech Framework:</strong> Speech recognition is processed on-device or through Apple's servers, subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>Your practice history is stored locally on your device. We do not operate external servers that store your personal data. All communication with third-party APIs uses encrypted HTTPS connections.</p>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>TenseUp is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device, you can delete it at any time by deleting the App. To cancel your subscription, go to Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions on your device.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
